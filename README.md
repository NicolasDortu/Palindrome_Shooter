# Palindrome_Shooter
### Code for my level Palindrome_Shooter in the game Joy of Programming - Software Engineering Simulator. <br>
The goal is to shoot the excessive characters (reprensented by colored targets) to build the biggest palindrome possible. <br>
Highly inspired by the level Shooting_Range_2 (I used it as the base of the code): <br>
